    <p>07-19-17: Python and Scratch are both computer languages that interpret commands, such as conditionals (booleans, strings, and numbers), for specific outcomes. One difference is, of course, that Scratch uses physical blocks while Python gives the coder more room to manually create his own code instead of searching for it in a list of many commands. Whereas Scratch is more visual in its use of sprites, Python is more logical, unless you use a library like Turtle. Today I used my Scratch knowledge to 
 makes shapes on Python. Overall the transition went smoothy, but when I was making my function, I defined all of my vairables, set my paramenters, and forgot to include all the other elemnts like moving forward and setting the pen down. I missed the giant Scratch blocks because they made sure I wouldn't miss a step. There's a lot to keep track of on Python!</p>
